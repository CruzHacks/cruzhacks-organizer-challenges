# CruzHacks Organizer Technical Challenges

Thank you for putting forth your candidacy for the CruzHacks 2024 organizing team. We're excited by the possibility of working with you!
* Please make sure to complete the [organizer application form](https://tinyurl.com/cruzhacks2023-organizer-app) by Saturday, May 20th at 11:59PM.
* Challenge materials are due on Saturday, May 20th at 11:59PM. Our team will review your submissions after the deadline and let you know what to expect next.

## Purpose

If you applied for the Engineering or Design teams, you will need to complete an additional technical challenge. The purpose of these challenges is to assess your technical skills and give you a preview of the type of projects you might be working on as a part of our team.

There are a number of traits we look for in prospective engineers and designers. We don't expect all candidates to be experienced professionals - far from it. Qualities of a successful organizer that supersede technical skills include empathy, teamwork, communication, and accountability.

These traits are difficult to discern from a technical challenge. While high performance on coding challenges will help your application, other factors will be taken into account as well.

## Instructions

Please review the following documents for instructions on your challenge.

- **For engineering -** one or both of the following challenges:
  - [Backend challenge](https://github.com/CruzHacks/cruzhacks-organizer-challenges/blob/master/backend-challenge.md)
  - [Frontend challenge](https://github.com/CruzHacks/cruzhacks-organizer-challenges/blob/master/frontend-challenge.md)  
- **For design -** the following challenge:
  - [Design challenge](https://github.com/CruzHacks/cruzhacks-organizer-challenges/blob/master/design-challenge.md)

## Challenge Submissions

Engineering candidates can submit either of the coding challenges, or both. Design candidates are required to complete one of the design challenges. If you're a candidate for both teams, you must submit both challenges.

- **To submit:** you must email **contact@cruzhacks.com** with the subject line **Cruzhacks Challenge - Last, First**, as well as:
  - **For engineering:** a link to the Github repo or a zip for your project. Included in the repo's README.md file should be simple instructions on how to run your project. 
  - **For design:** your file(s) as an attachment.

All materials must be submitted by Saturday, May 20th at 11:59PM.
